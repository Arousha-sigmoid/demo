This trend can indicate a sporadic acquisition strategy or external factors influencing monthly wins.\n\n- **Hospitals Lost**: The number of hospitals lost fluctuates each month, with certain months showing higher losses. This variability might suggest challenges in retention or competition in certain periods.\n\n- **Rolling Net Hospitals Won**: The trend line is moving generally upward from January 2022 to mid-2024, indicating a steady net increase in the number of hospitals won, even as there are fluctuations in monthly gains and losses. This suggests that despite some months with notable hospital losses, the overall trend is one of growth, with more hospitals being won than lost on a rolling basis.\n\nTo strengthen performance, identifying specific months or conditions contributing to high losses could help strategize retention efforts, while months with high wins can provide insights for replicating success in other periods."

This indicates strong underlying growth momentum, where the average quarterly births won (50,602) significantly exceeds the average quarterly births lost (18,057).\n\n- **Growth Spikes**: Quarters like Q2 2024 and Q4 2022 stand out with the highest net births and births won respectively, reflecting periods of intensified growth. These quarters may align with successful strategic efforts, promotional campaigns, or other beneficial conditions.\n\n- **Challenging Periods**: Q1 2022 shows the highest losses and lowest net births (-9,016), signaling a potential challenge at the beginning of the observed period. This may have been due to market entry issues, heightened competition, or other adverse conditions that the company overcame in later quarters.\n\n- **Strategic Insights**: The quarterly highs and lows can inform future strategic planning by highlighting periods of strength and vulnerability. The data suggests that certain quarters consistently perform better, possibly pointing to predictable cycles or windows of opportunity for concentrated efforts.\n\nThis quarterly trend analysis reflects both resilience and expansion potential, underscoring the company's ability to grow sustainably while navigating seasonal variations."
